**Abstract**


We introduce **Ragas** ( **R** etrieval **A** ugmented
**G** eneration **As** sessment), a framework for
reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAG
systems are composed of a retrieval and an
LLM based generation module, and provide
LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual
database, which enables them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual
databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations.
Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, challenging because there are several dimensions to
consider: the ability of the retrieval system to
identify relevant and focused context passages,
the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages
in a faithful way, or the quality of the generation itself. With Ragas, we put forward a suite
of metrics which can be used to evaluate these

different dimensions _without having to rely on_
_ground truth human annotations_ . We posit that
such a framework can crucially contribute to
faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures,
which is especially important given the fast
adoption of LLMs.


**1** **Introduction**


Language Models (LMs) capture a vast amount
of knowledge about the world, which allows them
to answer questions without accessing any external sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of
knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction
of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more
firmly established with the introduction of ever
larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture
enough knowledge to rival human performance
across a wide variety of question answering benchmarks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using
LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamental limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer
questions about events that have happened after
they were trained. Second, even the largest models



struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely
mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al.,
2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution
to these issues is to rely on _Retrieval Augmented_
_Generation (RAG)_ (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al.,
2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question
then essentially involves retrieving relevant passages from a corpus and feeding these passages,
along with the original question, to the LM. While
initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for
retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work
has suggested that simply adding retrieved documents to the input of a standard LM can also work
well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi
et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrievalaugmented strategies in combination with LLMs
that are only available through APIs.
While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented
strategies is clear, their implementation requires
a significant amount of tuning, as the overall performance will be affected by the retrieval model,
the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt formulation, among others. Automated evaluation of
retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In
practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms
of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by measuring perplexity on some reference corpus. However, such evaluations are not always predictive
of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c).
Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM
probabilities, which are not accessible for some
closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Question answering is another common evaluation task,
but usually only datasets with short extractive answers are considered, which may not be representative of how the system will be used.
To address these issues, in this paper we present
Ragas [1], a framework for the automated assessment


1 Ragas is available at [https://github.com/](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)
[explodinggradients/ragas.](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas)


of retrieval augmented generation systems. We focus on settings where reference answers may not be
available, and where we want to estimate different
proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The Ragas frame[work provides an integration with both llama-index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index)
[and Langchain, the most widely used frameworks](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate Ragas into their standard
workflow.


**2** **Related Work**


**Estimating faithfulness using LLMs** The problem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated
responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al.,
2023). Several authors have suggested the idea
of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompting strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analyses, however, suggest that existing models struggle
with detecting hallucination when using standard
prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and
Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking
the generated responses to facts from an external
knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not
always possible.
Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabilities assigned to individual tokens, where we would
expect the model to be less confident in hallucinated answers than in factual ones. For instance,
BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality
by looking at the conditional probability of the generated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022)
use a variation of this idea. Starting from the observation that LLMs provide well-calibrated probabilities when answering multiple-choice questions,
they essentially convert the problem of validating
model generated answers into a multiple-choice
question which asks whether the answer is true or
false. Rather than looking at the output probabilities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train
a supervised classifier on the weights from one of
the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a
given statement is true or not. While the approach
performs well, the need to access the hidden states
of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that
access LLMs through an API.
For models that do not provide access to token
probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, different methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul
et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sampling multiple answers. Their core idea is that



factual answers are more stable: when an answer is

factual, we can expect that different samples will
tend to be semantically similar, whereas this is less
likely to be the case for hallucinated answers.


**Automated evaluation of text generation systems**
LLMs have also been leveraged to automatically
evaluate other aspects of generated text fragments,
beyond factuality. For instance, GPTScore (Fu
et al., 2023) uses a prompt that specifies the considered aspect (e.g. fluency) and then scores passages
based on the average probability of the generated
tokens, according to a given autoregressive LM.
This idea of using prompts was previously also
considered by Yuan et al. (2021), although they
used a smaller fine-tuned LM (i.e. BART) and did
not observe a clear benefit from using prompts. Another approach directly asks ChatGPT to evaluate
a particular aspect of the given answer by providing a score between 0 and 100, or by providing a
rating on a 5-star scale (Wang et al., 2023a). Remarkably, strong results can be obtained in this
way, although it comes with the limitation of being
sensitive to the design of the prompt. Rather than
scoring individual answers, some authors have also
focused on using an LLM to select the best answer
among a number of candidates (Wang et al., 2023b),
typically to compare the performance of different
LLMs. However, care is needed with this approach,
as the order in which the answers is presented can
influence the result (Wang et al., 2023b).
In terms of how ground truth answers or, more
generally, generations, have been typically used
in the literature, most approaches have relied on
the availability of one or more reference answers.
For instance, BERTScore (Zhang et al., 2020)
and MoverScore (Zhao et al., 2019) use contextualised embeddings, produced by a pre-trained
BERT model, to compare the similarity between
the generated answer and the reference answers.
BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) similarly uses reference answers to compute aspects such as precision
(estimated as the probability of generating the generated answer given the reference) and recall (estimated as the probability of generating the reference
given the generated answer).


**3** **Evaluation Strategies**


We consider a standard RAG setting, where given a
question _q_, the system first retrieves some context
_c_ ( _q_ ) and then uses the retrieved context to generate
an answer _a_ _s_ ( _q_ ) . When building a RAG system,


we usually do not have access to human-annotated
datasets or reference answers. We therefore fo
cus on metrics that are fully self-contained and
reference-free. We focus in particular three quality
aspects, which we argue are of central importance.
First, **Faithfulness** refers to the idea that the answer should be grounded in the given context. This
is important to avoid hallucinations, and to ensure
that the retrieved context can act as a justification
for the generated answer. Indeed, RAG systems are
often used in applications where the factual consistency of the generated text w.r.t. the grounded
sources is highly important, e.g. in domains such as
law, where information is constantly evolving. Second, **Answer Relevance** refers to the idea that the
generated answer should address the actual question that was provided. Finally, **Context Relevance**
refers to the idea that the retrieved context should

be focused, containing as little irrelevant information as possible. This is important given the cost
associated with feeding long context passages to
LLMs. Moreover, when context passages are too
long, LLMs are often less effective in exploiting
that context, especially for information that is provided in the middle of the context passage (Liu
et al., 2023).
We now explain how these three quality aspects
can be measured in a fully automated way, by
prompting an LLM. In our implementation and
experiments, all prompts are evaluated using the
gpt-3.5-turbo-16k model, which is available
through the OpenAI API [2] .


**Faithfulness** We say that the answer _a_ _s_ ( _q_ ) is
faithful to the context _c_ ( _q_ ) if the claims that are
made in the answer can be inferred from the con
text. To estimate faithfulness, we first use an LLM
to extract a set of statements, _S_ ( _a_ _s_ ( _q_ )) . The aim
of this step is to decompose longer sentences into
shorter and more focused assertions. We use the
following prompt for this step [3] :


_Given a question and answer, create one_
_or more statements from each sentence_
_in the given answer._
_question:_ [question]
_answer:_ [answer]


where [question] and [answer] refer to the
given question and answer. For each statement _s_ _i_


2 [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
3 To help clarify the task, we include a demonstration as
part of the prompt. This demonstration is not explicitly shown
in the listing of the prompts throughout this paper.



in _S_, the LLM determines if _s_ _i_ can be inferred from
_c_ ( _q_ ) using a verification function _v_ ( _s_ _i_ _, c_ ( _q_ )) . This
verification step is carried out using the following

prompt:


_Consider the given context and following_
_statements, then determine whether they_
_are supported by the information present_
_in the context. Provide a brief explana-_
_tion for each statement before arriving_
_at the verdict (Yes/No). Provide a final_
_verdict for each statement in order at the_
_end in the given format. Do not deviate_
_from the specified format._
_statement:_ [statement 1]

...

_statement:_ [statement _n_ ]


The final faithfulness score, _F_, is then computed

_[|]_
as _F_ = _[|]_ _|_ _[V]_ _S|_ [, where] _[ |][V][ |]_ [ is the number of statements]

that were supported according to the LLM and _|S|_
is the total number of statements.


**Answer relevance** We say that the answer _a_ _s_ ( _q_ )
is relevant if it directly addresses the question in
an appropriate way. In particular, our assessment
of answer relevance does not take into account fac
tuality, but penalises cases where the answer is
incomplete or where it contains redundant information. To estimate answer relevance, for the given
answer _a_ _s_ ( _q_ ), we prompt the LLM to generate _n_
potential questions _q_ _i_ based on _a_ _s_ ( _q_ ), as follows:


_Generate a question for the given answer._
_answer_ : [answer]


We then obtain embeddings for all questions using the text-embedding-ada-002 model, available from the OpenAI API. For each _q_ _i_, we calculate the similarity sim( _q, q_ _i_ ) with the original
question _q_, as the cosine between the corresponding embeddings. The answer relevance score, AR,
for question _q_ is then computed as:



This metric evaluates how closely the generated
answer aligns with the initial question or instruction.


**Context relevance** The context _c_ ( _q_ ) is considered relevant to the extent that it exclusively contains information that is needed to answer the question. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the



AR = [1]


_n_



_n_
� sim( _q, q_ _i_ ) (1)


_i_ =1


inclusion of redundant information. To estimate

context relevance, given a question _q_ and its context _c_ ( _q_ ), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences,
_S_ _ext_, from _c_ ( _q_ ) that are crucial to answer _q_, using
the following prompt:


_Please extract relevant sentences from_
_the provided context that can potentially_
_help answer the following question. If no_
_relevant sentences are found, or if you_
_believe the question cannot be answered_
_from the given context, return the phrase_
_"Insufficient Information". While extract-_
_ing candidate sentences you’re not al-_
_lowed to make any changes to sentences_
_from given context._


The context relevance score is then computed as:


number of extracted sentences
CR = (2)
total number of sentences in _c_ ( _q_ )


**4** **The WikiEval Dataset**


To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally
need examples of question-context-answer triples
which are annotated with human judgments. We
can then verify to what extent our metrics agree
with human assessments of faithfulness, answer

relevance and context relevance. Since we are not

aware of any publicly available datasets that could
be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset,
which we refer to as _WikiEval_ [4] . To construct the

dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages covering events that have happened since the start of
2022 [5] . In selecting these pages, we prioritised
those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages,
we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that
can be answered based on the introductory section
of the page, using the following prompt:


_Your task is to formulate a question from_
_given context satisfying the rules given_

_below:_

_1. The question should be fully answered_
_from the given context._
_2. The question should be framed from_
_a part that contains non-trivial informa-_

_tion._

_3. The answer should not contain any_

_links._

_4. The question should be of moderate_
_difficulty._
_5. The question must be reasonable and_
_must be understood and responded to by_

_humans._

_6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con-_
_text’, etc in the question_

_context:_


We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated
question, when given the corresponding introductory section as context, using the following prompt:


_Answer the question using the informa-_
_tion from the given context._
_question:_ [question]
_context:_ [context]


All questions were annotated along the three considered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both
annotators were fluent in English and were given
clear instructions about the meaning of the three
considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness
and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in
around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they
agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements
were resolved after a discussion between the anno
tators.


**Faithfulness** To obtain human judgements about
faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the
question without access to any additional context.
We then asked the annotators to judge which of the
two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard
one or the one generated without context), given
the question and corresponding Wikipedia page.


**Answer relevance** We first used ChatGPT to
obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel
evance, using the following prompt:


_Answer the given question in an incom-_
_plete manner._
_question:_ [question]


We then asked human annotators to compare this
answer, and indicate which of the two answers had
the highest answer relevance.


**Context relevance** To measure this aspect, we
first added additional sentences to the context by
scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia
page. In this way, we were able to add information
to the context that was related but less relevant for

answering the question. For the few pages without any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to
complete the given context.


**5** **Experiments**


Table 1 analyses the agreement between the metrics proposed in Section 3 and the human assessments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each
WikiEval instance requires the model to compare
two answers or two context fragments. We count
how often the answer/context preferred by the
model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, answer relevance, or context relevance) coincides
with the answer/context preferred by the human
annotators. We report the results in terms of accuracy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the
model agrees with the annotators).
To put the results in context, we compare our
proposed metrics (shown as _Ragas_ in Table 1) with
two baseline methods. For the first method, shown
as _GPT Score_, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score
between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions.
To this end, we use a prompt that describes the
meaning of the quality metric and then asks to
score the given answer/context in line with that
definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness,
we used the following prompt:


_Faithfulness measures the information_
_consistency of the answer against the_
_given context. Any claims that are made_

_in the answer that cannot be deduced_

_from context should be penalized._
_Given an answer and context, assign a_
_score for faithfulness in the range 0-10._
_context_ : [context]

_answer_ : [answer]


Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM
to both answer candidates, were broken randomly.
The second baseline, shown as _GPT Ranking_, instead asks ChatGPT to select the preferred answer/


context. In this case, the prompt again includes
a definition of the considered quality metric. For
instance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used
the following prompt:


_Answer Relevancy measures the degree_
_to which a response directly addresses_
_and is appropriate for a given question._
_It penalizes the present of redundant in-_
_formation or incomplete answers given a_
_question. Given an question and answer,_
_rank each answer based on Answer Rele-_

_vancy._
_question_ : [question]
_answer 1_ : [answer 1]

_answer 2_ : [answer 2]


The results in Table 1 show that our proposed
metrics are much closer aligned with the human
judgements than the predictions from the two baselines. For faithfulness, the Ragas prediction are in
general highly accurate. For answer relevance, the
agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the
fact that the differences between the two candidate

answers are often very subtle. We found context
relevance to be the hardest quality dimension to
evaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT
often struggles with the task of selecting the sentences from the context that are crucial, especially
for longer contexts.


**6** **Conclusions**


We have highlighted the need for automated
reference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In particular, we have argued the need for an evaluation
framework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the
answer grounded in the retrieved context), answer
relevance (i.e. does the answer address the question) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved
context sufficiently focused). To support the development of such a framework, we have introduced
_WikiEval_, a dataset which human judgements of
these three different aspects. Finally, we have also
described Ragas, our implementation of the three
considered quality aspects. This framework is easy
to use and can provide deverlopers of RAG systems with valuable insights, even in the absence
of any ground truth. Our evaluation on WikiEval
has shown that the predictions from Ragas are
closely aligned with human predictions, especially
for faithfulness and answer relevance.
